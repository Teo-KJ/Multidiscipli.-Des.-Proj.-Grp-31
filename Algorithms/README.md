# Algorithms

## Overview
The objective of the Algorithm sub-team is to formulate an algorithm that drives the robot through an unknown maze. There are two main phases of the algorithm - the exploration and the fastest path. The exploration involves the robot exploring the maze to detect the locations of the obstacles. This information is then stored for the execution of the fastest path where the robot finds the shortest path between the Start zone (coordinates: 1,1) and the Goal zone (coordinates: 13,18). In the process, the algorithm which is executed on the PC, communicates with the robot through the Raspberry Pi, to the Arduino and motors, and the Android tablet.
